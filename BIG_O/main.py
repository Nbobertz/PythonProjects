#the following code is used to calculate the big O for a program.

a = 1 #O(1)
b = 2#O(1)
c = 3#O(1)
array = [1,2,3] #O(1)
for n in range(0,len(array)): #O(3)/N
    print(n)#O(1)

#Big 0 is just how efficent your computer progam can be scaled. Ideally a big O(1) is what you want as it is constant.
