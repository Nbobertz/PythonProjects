This is a state guessing game.

Open all the files in the same folder or specify the path if you change it. From there run the main file and it will automatically import all the necessary packages. I have a class that runs in the turtle_writes_states file.

You will load up the .gif image of the conential U.S with a prompt box asking you to name a state. If you get it right it will write it to the correct location. The text will get misplaced on the longer state names. A workourd to this would invovle clickable dot elements but I didnt want to bloat the file.

Have fun, see how many you can get right!
